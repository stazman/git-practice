Basic Git Commands:

1. Create a local repo:

git init



2. Tracking AND staging files:

git add <file>
git add . [for all changed files]

git status
git status -s [for short form]



3. Committing files:

git commit -m 'Makes a commit message' [notice the grammar of this sample commit]
git commit -a -m 'Makes a commit message'

[The -a option lets you commit all unstaged, uncommitted files without specifically staging them]
[Note: the -a option doesn't work for any untracked files (which would usually happen because they're newly created files). The command git add still needs to be run to track the files before they can be committed at all.]



4. Viewing the latest unpushed commit on each branch:

git log --branches --not --remotes



5. Seeing changes in files:

git diff [shows changes in files that have already been added; doesn't show content of new, unstaged files]
git diff --staged
git diff --cached

[git diff --staged and git diff --cached do the same thing]



6. Pushing to local repo:

git push



7. Setting a remote:

git add origin master



8. Pushing to remote:

git push origin master


NOTE: Your commits are added to the remote repo individually and they are added to the contribution chart of green squares individually
