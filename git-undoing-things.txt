UNDOING THINGS:

Resetting staged files and commits

1. Resetting Staged Files

    git reset


2. Untracking a file or directory without removing it from your local file system (such as if you don't want to make a repo private or delete it and re-create it, but you've forgotten to .gitignore something after you've already pushed the empty file to a remote, or if what's in the file that's already been pushed to a remote isn't sensitive information)?

  Individual file: git -rm --cached <filename>

  Individual directory: git -rm --cached -r <filename>
